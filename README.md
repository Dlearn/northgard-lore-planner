Created by Dylan Ho for fun. Issues and feature requests are welcome in [Issues](https://github.com/Dlearn/northgard-lore-planner/issues).

## App

One of the things majorly lacking in Northgard is sharing builds online or with friends. I created this App so that people can share their Lore builds easily.

## Development Setup

Clone this repo, navigate into the directory, and run `yarn install` to install all the dependencies. Then run `yarn start`.
